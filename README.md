This is a social network for enterprises & organizations.

Installation
------------

If you are on ubuntu follow [ubuntu-specific installation](https://ci.open-paas.org/stash/projects/OR/repos/rse/doc/elasticsearch).

1. clone the repository

        git clone https://ci.open-paas.org/stash/scm/or/rse.git

2. Install and configure ElasticSearch and MongoDB

First install ElasticSearch 1.3.5, then MongoDB 2.6.5.

Retrieve source code of rse-scripts:

        git clone https://ci.open-paas.org/stash/scm/or/rse-scripts.git

Follow [documentation](https://ci.open-paas.org/stash/projects/OR/repos/rse-scripts/browse/elasticsearch).

You may have to specify the path to ElasticSearch plugin:

        export ES_BIN_PLUGIN=/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin

Then run the scripts (curl and java are needed) in the correct order:

        1_elasticsearch_river_install.sh
        2_config_elasticsearch_analyser.sh

Before running step 3, you must configure MongoDB cluster in replica set. Open `/etc/mongod.conf` and modify replSet

        replSet=rs

Then restart MongoDB

        service mongod restart

Change the hostname of the machine to 127.0.0.1

        hostname 127.0.0.1

Open the mongo shell (with `mongo`) and launch

        > rs.initiate()

About a minute later, you will have a PRIMARY prompt that will appear when checking the status of MongoDB

        > rs.status()

Then continue with 3rd script (when the cluster is running as a PRIMARY node)

        3_config_elasticsearch_mongodb_river.sh

If you missed something during the previous steps, a script `delete_elasticsearch_mongodb_river.sh` is available. After using it, please go back to step 2 again.

3. Install node.js

Please note that your version of node.js must be greater than version 0.10.28 but less than or equal to 0.10.36. We highly recommend that you use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install a specific version of node.

4. You may need some additional packages. For example with a Debian installation, as an administrator you should use the following commands (as an administrator):

        apt-get install build-essential redis-server npm python-setuptools graphicsmagick graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat

5. Install the npm dependencies (as an administrator)

        npm install -g mocha grunt-cli bower karma-cli

6. Install the gjslint dependency (as an administrator)

        easy_install http://closure-linter.googlecode.com/files/closure_linter-latest.tar.gz

    more informations [can be found here](https://developers.google.com/closure/utilities/docs/linter_howto)

7. Go into the project directory and install project dependencies (not as an administrator)

        cd rse
        npm install

If you have any problem relating to `node-canvas` during the dependencies installation,
make sure your system has installed [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/). Documentation [can be found here](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas).

Testing
-------

You can check that everything works by launching the test suite:

    grunt

If you want to launch tests from a single test, you can specify the file as command line argument.
For example, you can launch the backend tests on the test/unit-backend/webserver/index.js file like this:

    grunt test-unit-backend --test=test/unit-backend/webserver/index.js

Note: This works for backend and midway tests.

Some specialized Grunt tasks are available :

    grunt linters # launch hinter and linter against the codebase
    grunt test-frontend # only run the fontend unit tests
    grunt test-unit-backend # only run the unit backend tests
    grunt test-midway-bakend # only run the midway backend tests
    grunt test # launch all the testsuite

Fixtures
--------

Fixtures can be configured in the fixtures folder and injected in the system using grunt:

    grunt fixtures

Note that you must configure contents of files inside **fixtures/config/data** and **fixtures/esn-config/data/** to match your environment, particularly **fixtures/config/data/db.json** in which the host of the mongodb database is defined. Also note that this will override all the current configuration resources with the fixtures ones.

Starting the server
------------------

You should first start mongodb and redis-server.

Then npm start to start the ESN server !

    npm start


Your ESN can be reached at the following address: http://<ip>:8080. Now simply follow the wizard to
prepare your working ESN with MongoDB port (default is 27017)


Develop the ESN
---------------

Running `grunt dev` will start the server in development mode. Whenever you
make changes to server files, the server will be restarted. Make sure you have
started the mongo, redis and elasticsearch servers beforehand.

In addition, you can run `grunt debug` to start the node-inspector debugger
server. Visit the displayed URL in Chrome or Opera to start the graphical
debugging session. Note that startup takes a while, you must wait until the ESN
webserver starts to do anything meaningful.
